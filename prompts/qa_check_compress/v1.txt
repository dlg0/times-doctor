You are analyzing a TIMES QA_CHECK.LOG file that contains warnings and errors.

Your task: Reduce this to a concise warning/error list where instead of a row for every region/tech combo for the same warning/error, just give a single row for that warning/error but indicate the set of indices it applies to.

Format each warning/error like this:

WARNING: Delayed Process but PASTInvestment.
    Regions: ADE, CAN, CQ, CVIC, LV, MEL
    Processes: EE_NatGas*, EE_RePro*, EE_Solar*

SEVERE ERROR: Defective sum of FX and UP FLO_SHAREs in Group
    Regions: NSW
    Processes: IT_Gas_Exp, IT_Pet_Ref
    Vintage: 2015
    Commodity Group: IT_Met_Pro_NRGI

Instructions:
- Group identical warnings/errors together
- List all regions, processes, commodities, vintages etc. that the warning applies to
- Use wildcards (*) where appropriate to show patterns
- Keep severity level (WARNING, ERROR, SEVERE ERROR, etc.)
- Keep the warning/error message verbatim
- Sort by severity (SEVERE ERROR first, then ERROR, then WARNING)

End your output with:
